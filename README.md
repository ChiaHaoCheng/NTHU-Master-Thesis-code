## Title : Effects of Ignoring Failure Rate Heterogeneity on Mean Lifetime Estimation

## Abstract: 
  In the analysis of  failure times or event occurrence times, estimating the mean lifetime of subjects or the average time to event occurrence is an important objective. This thesis focuses on time data from right-censored or right-truncated samples, exploring the impact of ignoring failure rate heterogeneity on the estimation of mean lifetime or average time to event occurrence. Under the assumption that the time data follows an exponential distribution, we demonstrate that the maximum likelihood estimator exhibits a negative bias. We verify this phenomenon through simulation experiments and an analysis of real survival data. Additionally, the simulation experiments show that the negative bias persists when the time data follows a Weibull distribution.
